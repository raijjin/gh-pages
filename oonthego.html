	<p class="response-container">This is a smartphone based system for comprehensive eye exams. A few sensory attachments with the mobile app make eye care portable and affordable. By running the app in the background, it also adapts your phone's screen to the environment around you, reducing eye strain (feature also available for desktop). The first attachment is a attachable lense that allows the smartphone to capture the retina much closer. The last attachment is a filter that cones, dims, and bends the flashlight light to be suitable to point at the eye.</p>

	<p class="response-container2">In developed countries, many people are straining their eyes with overusing digital devices. While in underdeveloped countries, many are left without basic eye care. There is an estimated 703 million without eye glasses. With accessible eye care, blindness can be prevented for many people.</p>

<p class="response-container2">Availability of eye exams <br> In the developing world, 600 million people are without eye care. An estimated 703 million people don't have access to the eye care they need. The gift of sight can make the difference between a life of poverty and a life of opportunity. This poses a great problem because uncorrected vision is the leading cause of preventable blindness. To simply be able to do an eye exam could prevent many cases of blindness.  </p>

	<p class="response-container2">Computer Vision Syndrome/Digital Eye strain <br> This prolonged exposure to technology is a shock to our eyes with 65 percent of Americans reporting symptoms of digital eye strain. Prolonged computer/mobile use is considered to be more than 2 hours. Those who report eye strain use their computers or mobile devices for more than 2 hours a day. Because of eye strain, productivity can be reduced by up to 20%. Digital eye strain can be prevented for already developed nations because 90% of patients don't mention it to their optometrist. </p>

	<p class="response-container2">Availability of eye exams <br> To perform an eye exam accurately, the patient must take 4 tests. The eye muscle test, visual acuity test, visual field test, and slit lamp examination. <br><br> For the eye muscle test, this app uses the front facing camera to track your eye movement while the patient follows the light that is moving back and forth. This light is covered with a filter cone that pinpoints the light, as well as dims it so it does not affect the patients vision negatively. <br><br> The visual acuity test is a measurement of the patients vision. This app simply shows the alphabet at the correct scale to the patient, just like when reading the random letters that progressively get smaller. When taking the visual acuity test from the app, the patient must have another person for assistance. The patient holds a small paddle against one eye, while the assistant holds the smartphone approximately 10 feet away. <br> </p>

	<p class="response-container2"><br>For the visual field test, the lense attachment will need to be placed on the back facing camera. Simply scan across the patients eyes while the optometrist analyzes the your retina close enough to know the patients central and peripheral vision. </p>

	<p class="response-container2">Solving digital eye strain <br> To solve the problems regarding digital eye strain in developed countries, the use of the ambient light sensor would adjust your device to its surroundings. Based on the color hue the phone detects, the screen color and brightness will automatically adjust to the optimal level for your eyes. <br></p>

	<p class="response-container2">To develop and scale the app, data must be collected from professional optometrsits. Data received from using the app must also be recorded to be compared side by side with a professional diagnosis. By comparing these two data sources side by side, we can account for the chance of error. Patients will take the eye exam within a professional environment, as well as take O on the Go's eye exam with their mobile phone.</p>

	<p class="response-container2">From Jonah Lehrer’s article “The Future of Science is Art?”, it seems like the Lehrer believes the future of science is art. Because artists do not limit themselves to the facts, they are free to explore possibilities beyond those that lie right in front of their eyes. For abstract concepts, such as fourth dimensions, scientists “are forced to resort to metaphor” (Lehrer 5). This means that facts have little weight in how the concepts are interpreted by the general audience and that the traditional scientific method is trumped by artistic thinking. Lehrer also suggests that, beyond just improving the interpretation of  non-innate ideas, art can also push science forward, especially with regards to human nature. Because the humans are more than just different sets of cells put together, literature describing the ways in which humans think and act can be very important. In addition, because, as Lawrence Krauss says in his interview with Natalie Jeremijenko, “science doesn't prove things to be true; science only proves things to be false.” This limiting view can cause scientists’ discoveries to stagnate.</p>

	<p class="response-container2">In our project, we decided to create an application that takes healthcare into the hands of the masses. Specifically, we targeted vision difficulties because it is a growing problem among a generation of people who have grown up surrounded by artificial lights. From the seminar we went to with Mayank Goel we learned how he used different sensors already available on phones to create applications that would allow people to diagnose themselves. We thought to take it further by assuming in the future, phones and mobile devices would have more and better sensors that would allow them to detect things like eye pressure. Although our project is not particularly abstract, it benefits science by proposing an idea that is not currently plausible but could be in the near future. As Sian Ede says in the article “Ambiguities and Singularities”, “Visualising, abstracting, imagining, inventing, pretending, storytelling, representing and ceaselessly reinterpreting things are as important as...rational discourse and the presentation of empirical evidence” (Ede 2). So despite the implausibility of the app today, the thought is nevertheless significant.</p>
