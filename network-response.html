	<p class="response-container">In the article, <i>Six Degrees of Interconnection</i>, by Duncan Watts, explains the concept of "Network Space," through analysis of six degrees of separation that affects social space. Milgram tested an idea to see how distant people feel physically and socially. He found that those who seem distant in physical and social spaces actually are closer than imagined. In a "network space," individuals are nodes in a complex web of social, economic, and institutional ties. The six degrees mentioned relates to the closeness of a node. So, a close friend would be one degree, friends of friends may be the second degree, and strangers are the third degree. Although, even strangers have a degree of closeness to you as they can transmit disease or indirectly affect you with any of their actions. </p>

		<p>Network Space is a a concept that has not been so clear until now. Collecting data on the spread of information and analyzing the results have only been done on a large scale today. With all of the social media apps collecting individual data, the distant in physical and social space are very little. </p>

		<p>The problem with network space and feeling less distant physically and socially when you really are is a concerning result. In these nodes these individuals are closer to us than we think because of the access of information they have. We're constantly tracking down peoples emails or making the right connections with friends of friends of friends. These network spaces or nodes of individuals in a network affect us directly and much more than we realize.</p>
